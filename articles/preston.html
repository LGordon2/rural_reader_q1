          Teaching his mother how to properly type on the keyboard at only the age of six,
          it is a no-brainer why Preston Williamson is in the spot he is today: Technical
          Lead for CDW's SPS Team.  Having been with Oras for more than a year, Preston
          has been a key player for and one of the many driving forces behind, the CDW project.
          Preston has many responsibilities on CDW, all of which are performed with the utmost
          standards and with a keen attention to detail; technical reviews of the team's automated
          testing to comply with client audit-readiness standards, monthly regression testing
          support, and new resource on-boarding ramp up, to name a few.

          Preston enjoys spending time with his dog Vegas at the park, playing N-64 video games,
          hitting the gym, and hanging out with his friends.  Preston graduated from Forsyth
          Technical Community College in 2012 with an Associate Degree in Computer Programming,
          and he plans to attend school in the near future to receive a Bachelor's Degree in
          Computer Science.  Preston's enthusiasm, optimistic attitude, and diligent work ethic
          are some of the many qualities that make him a valuable Orasi family member.

          "Since arriving to Orasi, Preston's been quick in demonstrating expert level proficiency
          in the tools and has consistently applied himself to our project making significant
          contributions to our team's continued success.  As one of the youngest consultants at
          Orasi, he's proven to be an asset to the project and I'm sure his technical aptitude
          would translate well to new tools and projects." - Alfredo Gonzalez, CDW SPS Team Lead.
