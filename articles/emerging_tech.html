          Orasi is working to develop a systematic approach for keeping up to date with current and upcoming technologies and
          testing methodologies, including solutions outside of the HP world. Driven by customer needs and changes in the
          market, the strategy is tentatively called "Emerging Technologies" and Orasi has begun researching some of the new
          technologies that companies are adopting.  The idea is to cultivate skills and knowledge around many of the processes
          related to Continuous Delivery and Agile Methodologies, including many of the open source tools.
        </p>
        <p class='article-text'>
          Paul Atkins is helping to initiate this research, calling it "Development focused testing approach", and has developed
          a group of employees to assist him.  The focus is to cultivate skills and knowledge - not necessarily expertise -
          within a certain tool.  The aim is to prepare our organization for some of the new and different testing technologies
          and to ensure that our consultants are flexible enough to cope with these new testing methods.  There is also an
          emphasis on language-centric solutions based on the coding language, such as  Java, C#, Ruby, Python and others.
        </p>
        <p class='article-text'>
          The end goal will be to leverage that knowledge and be able to provide a strategy/framework approach for new
          technologies including documentation, working code, training, etc.  There will also be language-specific teams
          of consultants available to provide help and advice as well as to be used on projects involving that language.
          The consultants who have joined in this initiative come from different organizations across Orasi: Rural Testing
          (Greensboro and Atlanta), Mobile Testing, MPT, SAP, and others.  Most are currently assigned to billable projects
          but are volunteering their down time and after hours' time to contribute to the learning and research.
          Perry Thomas, Adam Thomas, Lew Gordon, Matt Watson, and Jessica Marshall have been identified as leads to maintain
          the groups' focus and organization.  They meet weekly with Paul to share what they are learning and to demonstrate
          some of the solutions being developed.
