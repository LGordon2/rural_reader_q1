        <h3>Office Maintenance</h3>

          As most of you know, part of my job is to keep the Greensboro office maintained and running smoothly.  Although I'm
          always on the lookout for maintenance issues that need to be addressed, your help is greatly appreciated in
          identifying these issues.  If you see something that needs to be attended to, whether the printer is broken or a
          swarm of ladybugs has taken up residence in the lights, please do not hesitate to let me know about it.
